            <h2>Fromm bill yo bytes</h2>
            <p> Organizers: Florian Cafiero (PSL) and Marie Puren (EPITA) </p>
            <p>This two-day workshop aims to unite academics, data scientists, and policymakers to explore the challenges and opportunities presented by the digital revolution in the public sector. It seeks to bridge two dynamic fields of research: computational diplomacy and computational humanities projects focused on parliamentary data. These fields, although yielding impressive results, have mostly developed independently. Understanding international negotiations as "two-level games" highlights the complexity of studying international disputes and domestic preferences, a task increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence to manage vast document quantities.

The workshop will focus on advanced computational techniques used to analyze political decisions and legislations, including machine learning, natural language processing, and big data analytics. These technologies are revealing new insights into legislative processes and international policy-making. However, the availability of necessary data for these analyses is not always guaranteed. Therefore, the workshop will also examine the processes and technologies involved in digitizing parliamentary records and international organization databases. This includes a thorough look at methodologies for converting extensive repositories of legislative documents, debates, and resolutions into accessible digital formats, ensuring the data is usable for computational analysis..</p>

            <h2>The Climate Change Obstruction track</h2>
            <p> Organizers: Florian Cafiero (PSL) and Ian Gray (Columbia University) </p>
            <p> Thanks to the generous support of the Climate Social Science Network, we organize a parallel track focusing on a specific application of computational diplomacy: the international negotiations regarding climate change policies at the United Nations (UNFCC). The productions of this track will illustrate the possibilities and challenges of the emerging field of computational diplomacy.</p>
