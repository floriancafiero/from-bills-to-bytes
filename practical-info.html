CHILDCARE
We understand the difficulties parents face and are committed to making our event as accessible and inclusive as possible. As such, we would also like to inform attendees that baby-wearing is permitted at the conference provided the conference is not disrupted. We are currently looking into designated breastfeeding spaces at EPITA, please let the organizers know if you would be in need of such space. Organizers can also provide recommendations for childcare providers offsite.

ELECTRIC PLUGS
Electric plugs in use in France are 230V/50 Hz Type C and Type E. They should be compatible with electric systems used in European countries except with the ones used in Cyprus, Ireland and Malta, UK, Switzerland or Denmark, and are not compatible with systems used outside Europe. Depending on your material, you might need an adapter. Please check the standards on https://www.iec.ch/world-plugs. Adapters might be difficult to find in local shops close to the conference location, but are easily found at airports or train stations.
